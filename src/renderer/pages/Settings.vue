<template >
<div>
    <h2>Application Settings</h2>

    <p>
      No Settings are avaible yet. <br>
      <br>
      Future Ideas would be import and export Settings. <br>
      That could be usefull if someone adds secured CDN / Server configurations that you may import. <br>

<script>
export default {
  name: "Settings",
}
</script>

<style lang="scss" scoped>
